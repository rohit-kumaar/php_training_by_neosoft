--> Php :- Stand for Hypertext Preprocessor.It is a very popular and widely-used open source server-side scripting language which is used to develop dynamic websites.
-> client side :- execute by the web browser (javascript)
-> server side :- execute by the server (database)
  -> scripting language :- interpriting langauge (line by line )
  -> Php scripts are executed on the server and the result is sent to the browser as plain HTML.
  -> We can integrate php with many databases like Mysql, PostgreSql , Oracle , Sql server etc.
  -> Php is case senstive language 
  -> extension is .php 
  -> Environmental Setup 
    -> xampp

    -> How we store the php files 
      -> htdocs 
      http://localhost 
    -> Php tags or delimeters 
      -> standard tag 
       <?php 
        ---
       ?>
     -> How we render |  print output
       echo :- we can write large amount of data 
       print :- we can write only 1 statement at a time because it return boolean (true|false)
     -> Comments :- to describe the code 
        // or # (single line)
        /*  */ (multiple line)
     -> htdocs / programs 
        first.php 
        <?php 
          echo "This is my first program";
        ?>
    -> How we run the program 
      http://localhost/programs/first.php 
        output 
        This is my first program 
    -> Every statement is end with semicolon (;)
    -> Embedding php within HTML

  -> Variables :- are the temporary memory location which hold input data.
     syntex:
       varname=value;
       -> Rules to define varname
          -> start with doller($)
          -> after doller their is an [a-zA-Z] or _ 
          -> after these combination of [a-zA-Z0-9_]
        eg:
        $empName="sumit";
        $emp_salary=34567;
   -> Datatypes :- type declaration of variables but in php it allow at runtime as per the variable value.
      -> integers (123,-123)
      -> string ("--" , '--'))
      -> decimal (23.45)
      -> boolean (true | false)
      -> array
      -> objects 
      -> null 
      -> resources
      --> How we find the datatype of a variable 
        gettype(variablename)
    --> constant :- It is a value that never be change , it is fixed and permanent.
        define("API_URL","http://abc.com/products");
        echo API_URL;

        -> $_GET[] :- form method is get 
        -> $_POST[] :- form method is post 
        -> $_REQUEST[] :- used wither method is get or post 
  -> isset() :- check the variable null or not 
  -> empty() :- check blank or not 
  -> trim() :- remove whitespaces 
  -> stripslashes() :- remove backslashes 
  -> htmlspecialchars()

  --> File Uploading :- It is a process in which we can upload file or folders in a server.
    To do this form method is always post and we use one attribute (enctype="multipart/form-data")

    $_FILES[] 
      -> tmpname :- $_FILES['att']['tmp_name']
      -> name 
      -> size 
      -> type 
      -> error
      -> when we upload file first it goes to tmp folder in the server then we move to the main folder in a server 
        move_uploaded_file(tmpname,movepath);
    -> header() :- redirect one page to another 
       header("location:dashboard.php")
