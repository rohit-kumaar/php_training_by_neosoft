      -> How we create session variable 
       $_SESSION['SESSIONNAME']=value;
      -> How we read the session 
        $_SESSION['SESSIONNAME']
      -> How we Delete the session 
        session_destroy(); // destroy all session 
        unset($_SESSION['SESSIONNAME']);//ONLY session is destroy 
    -> Query String (params) :-  pass data from URL.

    <a href="a.php?cid=101"> Edit </a>
    header("location:welcome.php?uid=$email")
